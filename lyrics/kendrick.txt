If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song Seem like the whole city go against me Every time I'm in the street I hear 
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain It was Me, O-Boog, and Yaya, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans It got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self Uh, warriors and Conans Hope euphoria can slow dance with society The driver seat the first one to get killed Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out At the same burger stand where hang out Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine Pakistan on every porch is fine We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time With the sliding door, fuck is up? Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk? Pickin' up the fuckin' pump Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all. Duck." That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce Now crawl yo head in that noose You wind up dead on the news Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies IV's on top of IV's Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys When you hop on that trolley Make sure your colors correct Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess M.A.A.d city 
Wake yo punk ass up! It ain't nothin but a Compton thang Chyea Real simple and plain I'mma teach you some lessons about the street It ain't nothin but a Compton thang Chyea How we do
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga Alls my life I Hard times like God Bad trips like Nazareth, I'm fucked up Homie you fucked up

When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?" And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga I'm at the preacher's door My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright

What you want, a house or a car 40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog Motherfucker you can live at the mall I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you In the presence of your chico ah! I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God

I keep my head up high I cross my heart and hope to die Lovin' me is complicated Too afraid, a lot of changes I'm alright and you're a favorite Dark nights in my prayers 
I remembered you was conflicted Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same Abusing my power full of resentment Resentment that turned into a deep depression Found myself screamin' in the hotel room I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me So I went runnin' for answers
 
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad Reality struck I seen the white car crash Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him Security guard for a month and ended up leaving In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up Cocaine laced in marijuana And they wonder why I rarely smoke now Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice 
Cocaine, weed Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc Sherm sticks, butt nakeds Make a nigga flip Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit One time's crooked and shit Block a nigga in Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis I'm still in the hood Loc yeah that's cool The hood took me under so I follow the rules But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me A couple drive-bys in the hood lately Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can Shots in the crowd then everybody ran Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave Mount up regulators in the whip Down the boulevard with the pistol grip Trip, we in the hood still So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers stand 
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me? Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat? Would you say my intelligence now is great relief? And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn They realizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits And the price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects I live inside the belly of the rough Compton, U.S.A. made me an angel on angel dust, what
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again (Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga) I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin' True friends, one question

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it I'm African-American, I'm African I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village Pardon my residence Came from the bottom of mankind My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide You hate me don't you? You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me And this is more than confession I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that 
I'm the biggest hypocrite in 2015 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean I mean it's evident I'm irrelevant to society That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me Curse me till I'm dead Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be another slave in my head Institutionalize manipulation and lies Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes You hate me don't you? I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank then peel out Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels bout I'm black and successful, this black man meant to be special CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you? How can I tell you that I'm making a killin'? You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that 
I'm the biggest hypocrite in 2015 When I finish this if you listenin' I'm sure you will agree This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification I'm African-American, I'm African I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Dareous Excuse my French but fuck you, no fuck ya'll That's as blunt as it gets I know you hate me, don't you? You hate my people, I can tell because it's threats when I see you I can tell because your ways deceitful Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy Remind me of these Compton crip gangs that live next door Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers" Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements Or watch BET cause urban support is important So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? Hypocrite!

Every time I write these words they become a taboo Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter is true Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it? I mean you need to hear this Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe Call me crazy, We can both be insane A fatal attraction is common And what we have common is pain I mean you need to hear this Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm That's your heartbeat It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines Sincerely, yours truly And right before you go blind P.S
You can get it, you can get it You can get it, you can get it And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want Poetic justice, put it in a song
How much a dollar really cost? The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo "20 on pump 6" - dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 20 years ago - can't forget Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals Tenfold; the liberal concept of what men'll do "20 on 6" - he didn't hear me Indigenous African only spoke Zulu My American tongue was slurry Walked out the gas station A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' He begged and pleaded Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it Told him, "Beat it" Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated Listen to me, I want a single bill from you Nothin' less, nothin' more" I told him I ain't have it and closed my door Tell me how much a dollar cost 
It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe 
He's starin' at me in disbelief My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see The reason why he was mad at a stranger Like I was supposed to save him Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck I never understood someone beggin' for goods Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could And this particular person just had it down pat Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? A humble man is all that we ever need Tell me how much a dollar cost 
It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe 
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment I never met a transient that demanded attention They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend I smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin' I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God" 
I wash my hands, I said my grace What more do you want from me? Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be Shades of grey will never change if I condone Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs
