This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She going do all it for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I am young, rich, and handsome
Uh, this shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son, yeah
This shit is not random
Woah okay

It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she going be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you
Cause I got what they got, I'm talking times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seeing right through
You're hollow, you follow
Everybody's not the real McCoy
Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
California out to Georgia, Florida then up to Illinois
When I listen to your music I just feel annoyed
Haters, I don't understand them
Bred Jordan ones from two thousand and one 
Today I think I want a Phantom
If I don't get it I'ma throw a fucking tantrum, woah

This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls, that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random (nope)
Everybody ain't got it, understand son (sorry)
This shit is not random

Imagine it, put the hours in and stayed passionate
Wasn't blowing money, I was stacking it
Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
Pay attention, none of this is happening by accident
Listen, I don't slack a bit
Game plan's solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now, nothing less is adequate
Grab a check, cashing it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference is now if finally found a way to manage it
What you think I'm paid for, nothing?
You must be mistaking someone
I had to go make that fundding
I'm trying to be great at something
Spend, not saving nothin'
Flying from the Bay to London
They say money talks but you ain't saying nothing shh
Now try and shade me, I'm like, "I guess"
Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
Sign CDs and I sign breasts
Understand, to these female fans

This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls, that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
I got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son
This shit is not random

There always I'm gonna take my time
We'll be making love until you call me beautiful
Let me come inside don't forget to turn off
The light inside when it's storming when
It's gone my heart says to me when you are
One of those nights lady, I'm fiending for
You yeah, yeah dream maker, how can't
I fantasize about you all through the night whenever
I'm down with what you're put here for
To change these tears of happiness trying to be your
Drug, do it every night honest to god,
And now the whole worlds changed 
Locks took my things and be on my heart
Away I can't do it baby just say yes no
No haters gonna hate let them change
You show this whole world thankful just being
Your fool, I don't you ever needed something so
Rescue me, I wanna be a play thing
Now I found myself asking, why are we
Gonna be around and want lovin' true so understand me
When all is what you do not appreciate
Anything I do, no matter how hard
I tried while you were a better
Woman now look how I ride for
You and it was hard for you,
Oh my boy, when you were
My world if it's loving that you still care
About me tell 'em I'll be your rose in
A glass, don't let them take
Your mama shoppin', be sure I know better
House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean up with her face, man
I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me I don't see the shade
Switch up my style I take any lane
I switch up my cup I kill any pain
Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right

Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Hands over my head thinkin' what else could go wrong
Woulda stayed in bed, how can a day be so long

Never believed that things happen for a reason,
But how this turned out removed all my doubt so believe
That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you,
So I'd do it all over again
For you

I missed the first train stood out in the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out removed all my doubt
So believe that for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you so I'd do it all over again

Oh, who ever thought a day gone so wrong could turn out so lovely
Yea, I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong, I wouldn't change a thing
Yea, yea
I'm a do it
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again

Do it all over again
I'd do it all over again
I'd do all over again for you
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you
Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If u wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinking
What in the world was I thinking?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothing to explain
I’m a fuckin black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin John Lennon lenses like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screaming "everybody's famous"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling
She think she love me
A broke hoe can only point me to a rich hoe
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', real life goals
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There’s so much money on the floor we buyin school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I eurostep past a hater like I’m Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapos serving yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so
And I every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
Glad you got someone new
Yeah, I see but I don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool
No more "please stop"
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, holmes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo holmes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
It's been a while since the two of us talked
About a week since the day that you walked
Knowing things would never be the same
With your empty heart and mine full of pain

So explain to me, how it came to this
Let's take it back to the night we kissed
It was Dublin city on a Friday night
With vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all night

We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought but never heard
Who would have thought it would end up like this?

But everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong

Before the worst
Before we met
Before our hearts decided it's time to love again
Before today
Before too long
Let's try and take it back before it all went wrong

There was a time that we'd stay up all night
Best friends, yeah, talking til the daylight
Took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose but so much to gain

Are you hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss
That you would drift on memory bliss
It was Grafton street, on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

We were thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Who would have thought it would end up like this?

But everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong

Before the worst
Before we met
Before our hearts decided it's time to love again
Before today
Before too long
Let's try and take it back before it all went wrong

If these clouds don't clear
Then we'll rise above it, we'll rise above it
Heaven's gate is so near, come walk me through
Just like we used to, just like we used to, yeah

Let's take it back before it all went wrong

Before the worst
Before we met
Before our hearts decided it's time to love again
Before today
Before too long
The Kicking ass says it's time to close
We're leaning on each other try'na beat the cold
Carry you're shoes and I give you my coat
Walking these streets like their paved gold
There anyone excuse's not to go
Neither one of us want to take that taxi home

Singing our hearts out standing on chairs
Spending our time like we are millionaires 
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Millionaires
Ooohoh ooohoh
Lost my heart and I hope to die
Seeing that sunlight hit your eyes
Been up all nigh but you still look amazing to me 
Yeah, 
Half the time of the night you only dream about
If a god came down he could take me now
Cause in my mind, yeah we will always be

Singing our hearts out standing on chairs
Spending our time like we are millionaires 
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Millionaires
Ooohoh ooohoh

Check out us at six in the morning
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune
I swear you may think you're rich 
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this
Look at us since six in the morning
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune
I swear you may think you're rich 
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this
Bridge.
And the band was on, playing our song
We messed up the lyrics as we sang along
But we didn't care,
Cause it felt like we where the only ones there
My feet where sore, my bones where raw
They're turning off the lights, when we where shouting more
Shouting more,

Singing our hearts out standing on chairs
Spending our time like we are millionaires 
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Millionaires
Ooohoh ooohoh

Look at us since six in the morning
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune
I swear you may think you're rich 
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this

Walking these streets like their paved gold
There anyone excuse's not to go
Neither one of us want to take that taxi home
To your brother, to your sister, to your misses, to your mister.
To your friends, to your foes, give the love around and back around it goes.
It all comes from the top and it spreads right round
Treat a man wrong he's gonna pass it on down
To the next in line, who's probably his wife bringing up his kids
Now watchin' mamma cry
And they pick it up, cause they learn everything
Life has a funny way of going in a ring,
End up growing up in trouble with the law
Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore
Now it seems that every brand new generation
Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation
Their trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation
That's lost its trust (that's lost its trust)
We gotta change before the train leaves the station
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation it takes blood,sweat, tears, innovation 
It starts with us, it starts with us.

[Chorus]
Yeah, it starts by giving love to your brother,
Giving love to your sister,
Giving love to your misses,
Love to your mister
Giving love to your friends,
Love to your foes,
Give the love around and back around it goes 
Give the love around and back around it goes 
Round it goes, round it goes,
Round it goes goes goes

Give the love around and back around it goes
Oh we're all just folks working in a wheel
Spinning all around life's cruel battlefield
Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day,
Watch it wash away
I bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away
Flutter from a butterfly forms a storm
Over half a million people die
Oh we don't care because we're all desensitized
We don't realize we're putting all this shit before our children's eyes
Now every brand new generation
Have all been growing up with cracks in their foundation
We're tryna fill a holes of a whole damn nation
That's lost it's trust (that lost it's trust)
We gotta change before the train leaves the station
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation
It takes blood, sweat, tears, innovation
It starts with us, it starts with us.

[Chorus]

Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)
Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)
Love to your friends (around it goes)
To your foes (around it goes)
Give the love around, back around it goes
See the thing about Karma is she loves a bit of drama, yeah
Loves to hunt you down and pay ya back for the things you did
Before you turn a positive to a negative
Better pray before you know exactly who the fuck you're dealing with
This is not a dress rehearsal, let me tell you kid
Whatever you put out there is coming back again
Years may burn (ohh)
Tables gonna turn
Karma's coming back around
Either way you're gonna learn
To give love to your neighbor, love to yourself
It don't matter bout your status
Man your health is your wealth
We can all point a finger but there's four pointing back at yourself
I'll be the bigger man now
Give a little help

Give the love around back around it goes 
Around it goes 
Give the love around back around it goes 
Around it goes 
Give the love around back around it goes
You've read the books, you've watched the shows
What's the best way, no one knows

Meditate, yea, hypnotized
Anything to take it from your mind
But it won't go
You're doing all these things out of desperation
You're going through six degrees of separation

You had the drink, you take a toke
Watch the past go up in smoke
You fake a smile, ya, lie and say
You're better now than ever and your life's okay
But it's not, no

You're doing all these things out of desperation
You're going through six degrees of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little

Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self

You tell your friends, yea strangers too
Anyone who will throw an arm around you
Tarot cards, gems and stones
Believing all the shit's gonna heal your soul
Well it's not, whoa

You're only doing things out of desperation
You're going through six degrees of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little

Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self

Oh no there's no starting over
Without finding closure
You take them back no hesitation
That's how you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

Oh no there's no starting over
Without finding closure
You take them back no hesitation
That's how you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little

You're going through six degrees of separation
You're going through six degrees of separation
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self
