First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my girl pregnant I'ma be a better you
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled, listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a guy

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame guys can't tell the difference
One time for a guy who knows

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searching through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was getting my feet rubbed
By the baddest girl, not Trina, but I swear to God
This girl will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?
"Sorry I'm never coming home I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any girl
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started calling girl girl so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweating me

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame guys can't tell the difference
One time for a guy who knows

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
guy I don't want no girl from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
guy you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back
guy you know how it go
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame guys can't tell the difference
One time for a guy who knows

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the girl probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[Hook:]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask The Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why You call on me

This is my canvas
I'm a paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'm a paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it guy
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong
Only a song
I like to write alone
Be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Apparently, You believe in me, You believe in me
Apparently, You believe in me and I thank you for it

Another day another rhyme hoe
Another day another time zone
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right
I got two girles playin' on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
guys eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
guy please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came guys can't wait for one of these
I see you guy, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP guy
I'm hot dog, catch up to me guy
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this girl
Like thanks for the view
Waiting on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cold as your phone on zero percent
Going off, now guys showing off
guys swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss
Too easy
Got me up all night
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night
Down and out with these love songs, she got me up all night
Drown it out with these love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Down and out with these love songs, got me open all night uh huh, got me up all night hey

OK, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a guy made heat, may I vent? Had a thing for you
Even wrote the song dreams for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a guy signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
'Cause now I'm in this girl and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you, I'm saying

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are, all I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are (she got me)
And we are we are we are (she got me)

Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a guy
Wifing in the club, man my homies' going disown a guy
Like, give me 20 dollar, dollar
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wondering if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hoping you alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall, each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a guy freeze-framed yelling please play
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever, but

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya, yeah

And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are, all I'm singing is love songs
And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are (she got me)
And we are we are we are (she got me)

Got me up all night
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night (all night)
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night (all night)
Down and out with these love songs, she got me up all night (all night)
Drown it out with these love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Down and out with these love songs, she got me open all night uh huh
Got me open all night hey
