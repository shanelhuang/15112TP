Is that her in the VIP-line With the Vuitton and Yves saint Laurent Used to drive the Nissan, now she in a Beamer I don't want 'er cause she from the corner And I heard that Beamer was a loaner Her old man, the owner And I don't even drink Corona's What type of drink you want girl I'm champagne forever I'm dirty Sprite forever You can come sit with me If you'd like to change the weather If you wanna live better We can buy a crib, wherever Don't get too thirsty, get used to this cheddar I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er 
Turn on the lights I'm lookin' for 'er too I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you I heard she ain't gone cheat and she gon never make no move I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through Turn on the lights 
Send 'er my way Tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er in the broad day Hangin' with the dope boys in the hallways And I know, to keep her, yeah, you gotta get that cake Turn on the lights I'm lookin' for 'er too I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowling And if I get the number, you know I can't wait to dial it And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wylin' And when we get together we make magic and it's ours Whenever you up here ain't nothin' nobody can do about it 
She a hood girl But she a good girl She been mislead Now she ready for the world I want your energy To take control of me I've tried to go to sleep And seen 'er in my dreams Just in case I run across her today I'm a stay clean Just in case you recognize her face, send 'er to me And tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight You can't tell a guy nothin' because I got my cash right And tell 'er if she honest and promise to stay true Make sure, when you tell 'er, tell 'er we going past the moon
Now here's a tune about this shawty named renee That I met one day On my way back from John Jay I'm peepin' shorty as she's walking to the train I tap her on her shoulders Excuse me Miss, but can I get your name She said my name is Renee I said I got a whole lot to say So may I walk you to your subway She said if you want So yo, we started talking I brought two franks and two drinks And we began walking I had to see where that head was at Because the gear was mad phat So we must chat about this and that She told me what she was in school for She wants to be a lawyer In other words shorty studies law I'm telling shorty I'm a writer And as she's looking for the token She drops a package of the EZ Rider Covers her mouth with her name ring I said, yo don't sweat the technique shorty rock I do the same thing But yet I use Philly Blunts She said I never dealt with Philly Blunts Because I heard that's for silly stunts I said, nah they burn slower Right now I really don't know ya But maybe later on I can get to show ya 
A ghetto love is the law that we live by Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday Give it up for my shorty  [x2] 
Now we sittin' on train Besides the fingernails Now shorty got the hairdo of pain Now understand she got flava A tough leather jacket, with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her Got off the train about 6:34 She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog so we hit the store Went to the crib And turned the lights on A crazy magazine stand From Essence to Right On A leather couch Stereo system with crazy cd's Understand kid She got cheese She said cheeks do what you want She said I'm gonna feed the dog I said alright well I'm gonna roll this blunt She came back with strech pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt A yo, Fam I got a tender-roni girl We're sitting on the couch chattin We're smoking blunts on her balcony We're stearing at Manhattan She started feeling on my chest I started feeling on her breasts And there's no need for me to stress the rest A yo, I got myself a winner We sparked a blunt before we ate And a blunt after we ate dinner She had a tattoo she only wanted Bo to see But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci I'm like whatever shorty rock We can swing it like that Cause on the real this is where it's at. 
A ghetto love is the law that we live by Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday Give it up for my shorty  [x2] 
I woke up the next day on the waterbed A letter's on the pillow And this what the letter said It said cheeks, I'll be home around two You was deep in your sleep So I didn't want to bother you I left a number for shorty to call me later Got dressed Smoked a blunt Then I bounced to the elevator I got a beep around three I'm asking shorty what's up with you She's asking what's up with me And now we been together for weeks Candlelight dinner with my shorty Crack a 40 with my naughty freaks A man, I never been in love But everytime I'm burstin' in and outta state It's shorty that I'm thinking of I'm hanging out with my crew I get a beep from Renee Because Renee uses code two But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes She said Renee has been shot So cheeks, meet me up at St. Lukes I jumps on the Van Wyck I gotta make it there quick A yo, this shit is gettin' mad thick Not even thinking about the po nine I'm doing a buck Who gives a fuck I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine I gotta see what's going on But by the time I reach the hospital They tell me Mr. Cheeks Renee is gone I'm pouring beer out for my shorty who ain't here I'm from the ghetto So listen This is how I shed my tears 
A ghetto love is the law that we live by Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday Give it up for my shorty 
Everyday I've been feeling the pressure
I always gotta know the plan
It's a weight that I've tried to shoulder
I thought I could, but I can't
And I'm so tired of chasing dreams
When I am wired to let you lead
You're changing my heart
To want what you want
To love how you love
And that is enough
There's no greater plan that I need to know
You only ask me to follow
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
Oh I'm feelin' this surrender
I feel myself come alive
And the burden feels like a feather
When I let my agenda die
And I get so tired of my own dreams
But I am wired to let you lead
You're changing my heart
To want what you want
To love how you love
And that is enough
There's no greater plan that I need to know
You only ask me to follow
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
So many leaders, you ask for followers
So keep on leading, cuz you're my father
So many leaders, you ask for followers
So keep on leading, cuz you're my father
You're changing my heart
To want what you want
To love how you love
And that is enough
There's no greater plan that I need to know
You only ask me to follow
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
And want what you, what you want
And want what you
So many leaders (what you want), you ask for followers 
So keep on leading (what you want), cuz you're my father 
So many leaders (what you want), you ask for followers 
So keep on leading (what you want), cuz you're my father
One love, one heart Let's get together and feel all right Hear the children crying (One love) Hear the children crying (One heart) Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

It's just a fly love song, what

Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm going to do the best I can do
Cause I'm the best when I'm with you

Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy

Put down your bags love

Has been sort of hard in you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me
May have to die with you

Come close to me baby

You promise so fast you just might take flight

I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny to we connected girl

When I'm alone in my room
Sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind
I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was, giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occurred, Tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself, "Look what you've done to her"
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe, pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amore, kissing you on the ear
Whispering "I love you" and "I'll always be near"
Although I often reminisce, I can't believe that I've found
A desire for true love, floating around
Inside my soul, because my soul is cold
One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half, needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love

I need love

Romance, sheer delight, how sweet
I've got to find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
Give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say "Ooh girl, you're so sweet"
It's De Ja Vu, whenever I'm with you
I can go on forever telling you what I'll do
But where you at? You're neither here nor there
I swear, I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search, is really making me bugged
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen?
Take a chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
And when I find you I'ma pour all my love inside
I need love

I need love

I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you
Grind, mold, and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I've got money but love's something I never had
I need your ruby red lips, sweet face and all
I love you more than a man, who's ten feet tall
I watch the sun rise, in your eyes
We're so in love, when we hug, we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in extacy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I've never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled, yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you, this is something I'll never forget
I need love

I need love

See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love, and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over with the slightest touch
Of your hand, and understand, I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it, in destiny's hand
I can't sit and wait, for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight, to keep my dream alive
I'd search the whole world for that special girl
And when I finally find you, watch our love unfurl
I need love

I need love

Girl, listen to me.
When I be sitting in my room, all alone, staring at the wall,
Fantasies, they go through my mind.
And, I've come to realize that, I need true love.
And if you want to give it to me girl, make yourself seen.
I'll be waiting, I love you.
Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
Turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You're waiting, hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow reckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't' where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You’re the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

Don't ignore, listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
