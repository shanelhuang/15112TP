So what we get drunk? So what we smoke weed? We’re just having fun We don’t care who sees So what we go out? That’s how its supposed to be Living young and wild and free 
So what I keep ‘em rolled up? Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show Keep it real with my bros Keep it player for these hoes And look clean don't it? Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it Give me some 501 jeans on it Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers You a class clown and if I skip for the day I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A 
You know what? It’s like I’m 17 again Peach fuzz on my face Lookin’, on the case Tryna find a hella taste Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint Up front, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J” 
So what we get drunk? So what we smoke weed? We’re just having fun We don’t care who sees So what we go out? That’s how its supposed to be Living young and wild and free 
And I don't even care Cause if me and my team in there There's gonna be some weed in the air Tell 'em Mac 
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin' When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up 
That's how it should be done Soon as you thinkin' you're down Find how to turn things around Now things are lookin' up 
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang 
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin' Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building Got my own car, no job, no children Had a science project, me and Mac killed it 
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me This is us, we gon' fuss And we gon' fight and we gon' roll And live off life 
So what we get drunk? So what we smoke weed? We’re just having fun We don’t care who sees So what we go out? That’s how its supposed to be Living young and wild and free 
Yea, roll one, smoke one When you live like this you’re supposed to party Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun So we just, roll one, smoke one When you live like this you’re supposed to party Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun 
So what we get drunk? So what we smoke weed? We’re just having fun We don’t care who sees So what we go out? That’s how its supposed to be Living young and wild and free

I'm walking through your streets
Where all your money's earning
Where all your buildings crying
And clueless neckties working
Revolving fake lawn houses
Housing all your fears
Desensitized by T.V.
Overbearing advertising
God of consumers
And all your crooked pictures looking good
Mirrors filtering information through the public eye
Designed for profit sharing
Your neighbor, what a guy
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Modern globalization
Coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations with a blinded flag
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game
The bottom line is money nobody gives a fight
4000 hungry children
Leave us per hour from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs
Creating death showers
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Why must we kill our own kind?
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Every time you drop the bomb
I wanna drive until my cell phone
Runs out of range and every bar is gone
Cut through the woods another hundred miles
And disappear for a while
I wanna hear raindrops fallin’ down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my travelin’ boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lyin’ next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low
I wanna end up nowhere on a map
A little cabin sittin’ so far back
Out in the country
Just the moon and stars
Are gonna know where we are
I wanna hear raindrops fallin’ down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my travelin’ boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lyin’ next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low
Just lay low, slow it down (Just lay low)
Girl, let’s go and get outta town
I wanna hear raindrops fallin’ down
I wanna hear raindrops fallin’ down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my travelin’ boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lyin’ next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low
Oh and just lay low
Just lay low
Konvict, music and you know we a front
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fight you, fight you, you already know
I wanna fight you, fight you, you already know
Money in the air as mo' fair
grab you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel 'ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk dog, but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture wit' me
What the flick gon' do
Baby, stick to me and I'm a stick on you
If you pick me then I'm a pick on you
D-O-double G, and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy, n' yours is right
Rip-ridin' them poles, and them doors is tight
And I'm a get me a shot before the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and, baby I'm pussy for life
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fight you, fight you, you already know
I wanna fight you, fight you, you already know
Shorty, I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of bros, n' they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me, now what's it gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryin' get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
You know my pedigree,
Ex-deala, use to move 'phetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothin',
An' besides I got a thing for you
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fight you, fight you, you already know
I wanna fight you, fight you, you already know
Mobbin' through club in the low-pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smokers section (just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your pussy is wet you rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' n' jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' you smilin', n' grinin', n' lookin' at me
Girl, n' while you're looking at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everythin' n' that's kinda scary
Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast, but I got a thing for you
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fight you, love you, you already know
I wanna fight you, love you, you already know
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fight you, love you, you already know
I wanna fight you, love you, you already know girl
Get your money, whip ya hair
Executive branch blow my smoke like a player
Yeah in the club, yes it cracks
Cute little mama, but they stack with backs
I'm smokin' great purple urple
You and Doggie world come and join my circle
I'll break down herbal til I move like a turtle
My money is green and my Porsche is turbo
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Maybe it's the lawyer, her body's the truth

I'm in the game for real, it pay's to chill
I walk in the club and they front the bill
I'm the big dogg, best beware
You're coming with me, if you stop the stare
She'll be on my team in my car on the way to the spot
Yes you are, toasting up, posting up
And when we're done, we west coasting love
For shendo blowin' endo,
How much for the Dog in the window

[Hook]

Boom!
Boom!
Say what? say what?
Boom!

On the VIP tip, Maserati in the lot
Kill 'em with stars where the bottle never stops
Got a model on my lap, Baby show me what you got
With a cup of landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls, wanna do it today
Real tough, this suites is next
One more drink gon' lead to sex
These girls is bad, the flow is pack?
They shut the Dogg down when he reach the max
Whatcha trying to drink? Clearer yet

That's what up. Boom!

Speak to 'em T-pain

Big 808 now filled the basin in ya chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta
Coke bottle shape like green eyes
Drunk offa love like a colt 45

Just bust a bad one for my homie D-Dimes
Boom!

I got five different strains,
You ever taste purple rain
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, it's still a G-Thang

Exhale the Chronic as the smoke disappears

Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg
