Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I got 'em?
Light another for the bitch who's just only in town for the weekend

[Hook: Chris Brown]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a guy feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell you I gotta chauffeur?
Think about it, think it over, everything is going be kosher
Call me when you getting closer
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya
This dick is our recognition
I don't mind paying that commission
Is you with the shit or nah?
If we ain't fucking then bitch, bon voyage
How many times? I said how many times?
Too many times and bitch I ain't got time

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay phone off the hook, yeah that bitch won't stop blinking
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring
You've been drinking and drinking, you're drinking for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leaving
Calling shots refereeing, no drama
Pussy so wet I'mma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements
I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favourite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

[Hook (partial)]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I see these bitches in supperclub
guys got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my guys, they whipping the bricks
Miami!
Dade County!
Lets ride!

I’m from Miami, bitch
Yeah, that’s Miami streets
And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat
Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat
Lets party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets
I’m no holds barred, baby, I’m gung ho
They sayin’, “Girl, you ain’t Jamaican, accents got to go”
And I say, “Hell no, hell no”
I got Jamaica in my lungs, it’s that good hydro
I got that Barbee flow, I’m feelin’ irie
Party, work and chill on the beach all day
Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood
Got my toes in the sand
And my God is the Sun

I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?” (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

We in that heat wave, where people ain’t phased
Workin’ to get paid
This town, they don’t play
The girlies like, “Yay”
They like the heart race
“White girl” on a white girl’s face
And I’m ?
We do it for the trills, trills, trills
We got enough bills, bills, bills
So keep poppin’ them pills, pills, pills
I’m chillin’ in my ?
Bring my girls to the damn party
Bro, don’t touch me, I got my own money
If you want a drink for free
Show my girls your body

I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?” (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

My town likes to party all of the time, all of the time
Take me down to prime
Give me a steak, if it’s bloody that’s fine
Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine
Let me clear my throat
(Yeah, yeah)
Have mercy babe, I hope you don’t mind, mind
I’m on a fucking boat
(Yeah, yeah)
And I’m thirsty babe, pass me the champagne, pagne

I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday, by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things
Getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world

All these chains that I'm wearing is not ordinary
My watches and my rings is not ordinary
Shawty what's the boo

Fuckboys hate to see me winning
(They tryna blackball me)
Kept shit 100 from the beginning
(They tryna blackball me)
They wanna see me lose everything I got
(They tryna blackball me)
Y'all keep hating, I'm right here on top

They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

I'm tryna fuck me thirty hoes by the end of this month
Ain't drive my Rolls Royce no more, I seen a fuck nigga in one
I heard some niggas downtown tried to jail me up
I heard they tell the Feds everyday to pick me up
But I'm like damn my nigga what I did to you?
And I'm like damn my nigga what you want me to do?
Want me to burn your pussy ass out and knock you off?
Want me to go by your baby momma house and kick in her door?
Guess what? Some 36 niggas, they’ll be here tomorrow
Don’t know what the fuck they goin' on, I’m gonna go buy some Lamar
My homie pulled me to the side and told me tell me the truth
She say she heard I’m fuckin' her sister I say she’ll fuck me and you

They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

Say, when you getting money, that shit bring plenty haters
Just cop that Phantom coupe, I list a Grammy later
White crib a couple acres, she fin that good Jamaica
They tryin to count me out, but bitch I’m back like Schwarzenegger
They tryina blackball me, don’t wanna see me win
Hit after fuckin' hit, like there he go again
They say I’m underrated, I’m just misunderstood
They can’t compare to me, I wish, I wish you would
I’m screaming, "Fuck the world and everything in it"
My homie beat his case, cause they can’t find a witness
You wanna test my G, man fuck this industry
I strap C-4 to your mattress, for all those who sleepin' on me

They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money
They want my name from me because they know what it do
They say I'm A-Rod, nigga, cause I got the juice
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court
They tryna blackball me, I should of went to the pros
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes

All these chains that I'm wearing is not ordinary
My watches and my rings is not ordinary
Shawty what's the boo

Fuckboys hate to see me winning
(They tryna blackball me)
Kept shit 100 from the beginning
(They tryna blackball me)
They wanna see me lose everything I got
(They tryna blackball me)
Y'all keep hating, I'm right here on top
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

[Verse 1]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That's the way we like the what, timber
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber

[Bridge]
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your body round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down

[Chorus]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

[Chorus]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

[Verse 2]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a dang thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on plane
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like Lebron, now, Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, wild, 'cause it's about to go down

Swing your body round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your body round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down

It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
Catch me on the getaway 
Like OJ on the highway, all white bronco
Catch me on the way to check out my dog
Mohombi all the way, all the way out in Congo
Catch me with a couple beautiful women that's ready for a combo
Let's hit the condo
Welcome to the new age hotel, California
Nice to meet you, Armando

You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria
You're like the sun in California
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria

No no 
Na na na no no no
No, I don't want to party without you (no I don't want to)
No no 
Na na na no no no
No, I don't want to party without you (no I don't want to)

Beats taking over the world
Y'all better get used to the fact
I jump on the track, drop the bass
And I ain't talkin bout crack
I was born in a era
Where Michael Jackson was still tryna figure out the man in the mirror
And when it came to drugs Miami would always stand and deliver
Welcome to the 80`s
Ladies and gentlemen
I took over the radio, I took over the clubs late night
No Letterman
My father, he was never there
But it made me a better man
The party's the world, the world's my girl
I dare you not to let her in

You're like the sun in California oh whoa 
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria
You're like the sun in California oh whoa 
Where there's no you, there's no euphoria

No no 
Na na na no no no
No, I don't want to party without you (no I don't want to)
No no 
Na na na no no no
No, I don't want to party without you (no I don't want to)

No I don't want to
No, I don't want to party without you (no I don't want to)
No I don't want to
No I don't want to

Some legends are told,
Some turn to dust or to gold,
But you will remember me,
Remember me for centuries.
And just one mistake,
Is all it will take.
We'll go down in history,
Remember me for centuries.
